## DOOM Eternal menu music mod

Download: https://www.nexusmods.com/doometernal/mods/393

Combine the raw action experience of Doom Eternal with Tyler McVicker's musical masterpiece "I Wish Hugo Martin Was My Dad" and finally discover what true art looks like. This mod replaces Doom's menu music with "I Wish Hugo Martin Was My Dad" and is designed to work with Update 5 build of the game.

**Installation:** Download and open the file *Hugofier.exe* and then click on the orange button with a file icon. When a dialog window show up, naviagte to your Doom Eternal installation directory and locate the file **base/sound/soundbanks/pc/music_patch_1.snd**. Now you can click the **PATCH** button and after your game files get patched, you should be good to go. If you wish to revert back to regular menu music, you can click the **UNPATCH** button and that should restore your game files to their original state.

**Notice:** I suggest you backup you **music_patch_1.snd** file before patching. It shouldn't be necessary but it's better to be safe in case if fucked something up in my code.
